-> every level is completely filled except the last level
->nodes always filled fom left to right

HEAP is a 
->complete binary tree
->data structure
->comes with a heap order property

**************************************************************

OPERATIONS of HEAP:

1. Heapify: 
    ->a process of creating a heap from an array.

2. Insertion: 
    ->process to insert an element in existing heap 
    ->time complexity O(log N).

3. Deletion: 
    ->deleting the top element of the heap or the highest priority element, 
    ->and then organizing the heap and returning the element 
    ->with time complexity O(log N).

4. Peek: 
    ->to check or find the most prior element in the heap, 
    ->(max or min element for max and min heap).

**************************************************************

TYPES OF HEAP DS:

1. Max-Heap: 
->key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of its children. 
->The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

2. Min-Heap: 
->key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of its children. 
->The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
